I would create a scale of energy, with the max possible value of energy, valence and danceability.
Then I would take the averages of those and categorize the top 100 songs of a person into one of these.

For example if a person listenes always to high energetic, high valence and high danceability music
I would give that person the highest Excitement Aura. If the person listenst to low valued songs
Id give that person the lowest excitement aura.

However, this categorization is a very naiive one, since a person might be excited but not really
into dance music. There are a lot of nuances that need to be considered, like at which seasons that
person listened to a particular song, since the summer tends to be more energetic than the winter.

Sad songs can also be very energetic, so a person who listens to energetic music might be sad
or happy. A way to improve this evaluation might be looking for keywords in the text of the
songs played that would steer the aura into one way or the other. One could even make a simple
formula of a happiness index based on those keywords and consider that in the aura evaluation.
